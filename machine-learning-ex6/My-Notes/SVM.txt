SVM is a sophisticated classification model that can provide a high margin for the boundary line. The derivation of the SVM is detailed in the notebook.
This derivation is wrt the class of Prof Patrick Winston. Now, I have to reconcile with what he taught and what Andrew is teaching.
Till now, I have been able to reconcile that in both the cases, they arrived at the optimization objective function as same as
||theta||^2/2
THis has to be minimized, keeping the constraints intact. To do this Patrick used Langrage's equation.
Let me see what Andrew does.
